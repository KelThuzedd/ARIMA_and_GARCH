# ARIMA_and_GARCH_GAZP_predict
  
1 For the selected stock (or index), compare different specifications of volatility models
(GARCH, IGARCH, EGARCH, TGARCH, GARCH-M, no more than 4-6 parameters) based on:
absence of autocorrelation in residuals and squared residuals, minimum information criteria,
economy of parameters.
  
2 Choose two best specifications for volatility models.
  
3 Build an interval forecast for stock prices (or an index) and an interval forecast for volatility
based on both models. Use 90% confidence interval for predictions.
  
4 Build interval forecasts for one (best, in your opinion) model from the data position at the
end of June 2008, and compare these forecasts with the actual dynamics of stock prices in
2008-2010. The same can be done on newer data for the crisis that occurred in February-May
2020 For Russian stocks, you can take the November 2021-March 2022 crisis. Estimate VaR and
compare it with the actual drawdown.
